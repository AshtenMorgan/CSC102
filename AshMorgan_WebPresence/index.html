                <p1>     
                    My name is Ashten Morgan (yes, with an E), and I hail from the cotton capital of the United States, <br>
                    Louisiana. Growing up, I was always known for drawing and painting and for my love of video games, so <br>
                    that was foundational as I grew in my hobbies and started thinking about my future. Despite the many <br>
                    inevitable challenges and uncertainties, I was always certain that I wanted to do cool things with art.
                    <br><br>
                    For as long as I can remember, I've been drawing characters and icons from my favorite games and <br>
                    media, ranging from Samus Aran of Metroid (a personal favorite) to my iconic "custom colossi designs" <br>
                    inspired by the monolithic beings from the Shadow of the Colossus game. I remember when I was <br>
                    around the age of 13, my stepmom asked me and my siblings what we wanted to be when we grew up. <br>
                    My older brother said he wanted to be a professional wrestler. My younger sisters wanted to be <br>
                    princesses and explorers. 
                    <br><br>
                    I wanted to be, as I put it, a "game designer". 
                    <br><br>
                    At the age of 18, I began pursuing a BA in Game Art & Animation, and this site is dedicated to my best <br>
                    work. 
                    <br><br>
                    Welcome to my portfolio.
